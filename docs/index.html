<h2>What?</h2>

<p>This Android app allows you to quickly turn off noise cancellation on Bose 700 headphones.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Bose 700 headphones have a "noise control" button to cycle through noise cancellation presets, but these are on a scale (three presets between 0-10) from actively passing external sound through, to cancelling out external sound.  In a very quiet room, any setting on this scale can result in an audible hiss, and you may not want any active pass-through/cancelling at all, but just the sound.  The official <em>Bose Music</em> app does allow you to temporarily turn off noise cancelling, but this setting is buried in the app and takes some time to get to.</p>

<h2>When?</h2>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
<li>turn off noise cancellation through this app, or</li>
<li>add as a quick settings <em>tile</em> to turn off with as single touch, or</li>
<li>add a single touch shortcut you can pin to your launcher.</li>
</ul>

<p>Noise cancelling will turn back on if you press the Noise Control button on the left ear cup, or when you next turn the headphones on.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>The application sends a short message (repeated 3 times) over the device's Serial Port Profile (SPP) connection, in hex:</p>

<blockquote><pre>01 05 02 02 00 00</pre></blockquote>

<!--

Noise cancellation `enabled` (0=off, 1=on), if enabled, on `level` (0-10):

Send: 0x01 0x05 0x02 0x02 (10-level) (enabled)

When toggling enabled on or off, device always starts at level=10 regardless of level sent, so a second repeat packet is required to resume to a level other than 10.

Response: 0x01 0x05 0x03 0x03 0x0b (10-level) (enabled)

-->
