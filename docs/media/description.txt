Noise Cancelling Switch

Quickly turn off noise cancellation on Bose 700 headphones.

This app allows you to quickly turn off noise cancellation on Bose 700 headphones.  

This is a third-party app and NOT linked in any way to Bose.

Bose 700 headphones have a "noise control" button to cycle through noise cancellation presets, but these are on a scale (three presets between 0-10) from actively passing external sound through, to cancelling out external sound.  In a very quiet room, any setting on this scale can result in an audible hiss, and you may not want any active pass-through/cancelling at all, but just the sound.  The official Bose Music app does allow you to temporarily turn off noise cancelling, but this setting is buried in the app and takes some time to get to.

You can:

* turn off noise cancellation through this app, or

* add as a quick settings tile to turn off with as single touch, or

* add a single touch shortcut you can pin to your launcher.

Noise cancelling will turn back on if you press the Noise Control button on the left ear cup, or when you next turn the headphones on.
